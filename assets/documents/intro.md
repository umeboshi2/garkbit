# The Waiter at the End of the Universe 
#### (or just a unique name for an app)

A couple of apps:

1. [The Movie DB (tv shows)](#moviedb)

	Search for television shows, as well as movies. Shows a
	list of episodes if available.
  
1. [TV Maze API demo](#tvmaze)

	a local browser database.
	

	

This site is running:

- [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) -
  Twitter Bootstrap is a very popular and useful css framework.

- [backbone.marionette](https://marionettejs.com/)
  Backbone provides models, collections and basic views.  Marionette 
  helps make view layout and management much easier.
  
- [tbirds](https://github.com/umeboshi2/tbirds/)
  Tbirds is the simple framework I created specifically for creating
  single page applications using bootstrap and backbone.marionette.
